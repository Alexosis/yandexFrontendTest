Use `node index.js` to start this program in default mode (same as flag `-R`).

Use flags:
* `-R` - to run this application with a random board size (from [5x5] to [10x7])
  and random init state
* `-F` - to run this application with initialisation from a file.
  After this flag, you need to add a path to the file (default value: "input.txt").
